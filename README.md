# Demographic Data Analyzer

## Introduction
Demographic Data Analyzer uses pandas to load demographic data extracted from a 1994 Census database to answer demographic questions  such as What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree? or What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?.
